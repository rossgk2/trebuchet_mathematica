# Trebuchet simulation

The Mathematica file runs a simultation of how a specific real-life (but small) trebuchet fires projectiles. The paper describes the sucesses and limitations of the trebuchet.

ABSTRACT FOR THE PAPER

"We attempted to optimize the destructive capabilities of a trebuchet by theoretically and experimentally examining how changing the mass of the counterweight, the initial angle of the arm, and the presence of wheels impacted the speed of the trebuchet's projectile. After using a non-conservative force to capture the bending of the trebuchet arm during firing, we were able to closely match our theoretical and experimental results. These results supported the ideas that an increased counterweight mass, an increased initial arm angle from the horizontal, or the addition of wheels cause an increase in final projectile speed."


DIVISION OF WORK

The Mathematica file is 95% entirely my work. The paper was split between me and two other teammates, with me working less on the paper than the others due to my focus on the code. I produced the lovely diagrams in the paper.
