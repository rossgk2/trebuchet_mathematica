# Trebuchet simulation

The Mathematica file runs a simultation of how a specific real-life (but small) trebuchet fires projectiles. The paper describes the sucesses and limitations of the trebuchet.

The Mathematica file is 95% entirely my work. The paper was split between me and two other teammates, with me working less on the paper than the others due to my focus on the code. I produced the lovely diagrams in the paper.
